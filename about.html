      <b>The Practical Handbook Project</b>
<br>
This is the first in a series of Practical Handbooks for Higher Education

The flipped classroom phenomenon in Higher Education has forced many educators to reconsider on how to best to utilise lecture time. Many students are also voting with their feet with low attendance figures being recorded in many institutions. During the Higher Education in Transformation Conference 2016 (HEIT 2016) there were several highly energised debates and instructions/examples on how to implement active learning. A key point that emanated from these discussions was that lecturers needed practical direction on how to embed active learning strategies into the lecture room. With the ambition of meeting this challenge the authors have created a practically based resource, Active Learning Strategies for Higher Education, The Practical Handbook, which will include full instructions and examples for the delivery of active learning strategies for higher education. It is hoped that this book, and engagement with several strategies within it, will allow lecturers to redesign the time available with students to enhance their learning experience.

In this repostitiory you will find outlines of each strategy and additional elctronic resources available for download.
